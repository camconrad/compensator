# Voting Architecture

## Overview

The Compensator contract successfully implements the concept of having an **owner who votes directly through the contract** while **storing the direction of each cast vote**. This architecture creates a sophisticated delegation system where the contract acts as a voting proxy with complete transparency and accountability.

## Core Architecture

### 1. **Direct Owner Voting Mechanism**

The contract implements a **single-owner voting system** where:

```solidity
// Only the contract owner can cast votes
function castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, string memory reason) external {
    _castVote(proposalId, support, reason);
}

function _castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, string memory reason) internal {
    // CHECKS
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "Only owner can cast votes");
    require(support <= 1, "Invalid support value");
    require(!contractVoted[proposalId], "Already voted on this proposal");
    
    // Get the contract's voting power (all delegated COMP)
    uint256 votingPower = COMP_TOKEN.getCurrentVotes(address(this));
    
    // EFFECTS - Store vote information
    contractVoted[proposalId] = true;
    contractVoteDirection[proposalId] = support;
    
    // Store comprehensive vote data
    VoteInfo memory newVote = VoteInfo({
        direction: support,
        blockNumber: block.number,
        txHash: bytes32(0),
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        votingPower: votingPower,
        reason: reason
    });
    
    voteInfo[proposalId] = newVote;
    allVotes[voteCount] = newVote;
    voteCount++;
    
    // INTERACTIONS - Cast vote through Compound Governor
    COMPOUND_GOVERNOR.castVote(proposalId, support);
}
```

### 2. **Vote Direction Storage System**

The contract stores **comprehensive vote information** for every proposal:

#### **Primary Vote Tracking**
```solidity
// Tracks whether the contract has voted on a proposal
mapping(uint256 proposalId => bool hasVoted) public contractVoted;

// Tracks the contract's vote direction on a proposal
mapping(uint256 proposalId => uint8 direction) public contractVoteDirection;
```

#### **Detailed Vote Information Structure**
```solidity
struct VoteInfo {
    uint8 direction;        // 0 = Against, 1 = For
    uint256 blockNumber;    // When vote was cast
    bytes32 txHash;         // Transaction hash for verification
    uint256 timestamp;      // Timestamp of vote
    uint256 votingPower;    // Total voting power used
    string reason;          // Optional reason for vote
}

// Store vote info for each proposal
mapping(uint256 proposalId => VoteInfo voteInfo) public voteInfo;

// Track all votes for transparency
mapping(uint256 => VoteInfo) public allVotes;
uint256 public voteCount;
```

### 3. **Voting Power Aggregation**

The contract **aggregates all delegated COMP** into a single voting entity:

```solidity
// When users deposit COMP, it's automatically delegated to the contract
function userDeposit(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    // ... validation and effects ...
    
    // INTERACTIONS
    COMP_TOKEN.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    // Delegate voting power to the contract itself
    COMP_TOKEN.delegate(address(this));
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Single Voice**: All delegated COMP votes as one unit
- **Maximum Impact**: Full voting power used on every proposal
- **Simplified Logic**: No need to track individual delegator votes

## Vote Storage and Verification

### 1. **Multi-Layered Vote Tracking**

The contract implements **three levels of vote tracking**:

#### **Level 1: Basic Vote Status**
```solidity
contractVoted[proposalId] = true;  // Has contract voted?
contractVoteDirection[proposalId] = support;  // Which direction?
```

#### **Level 2: Detailed Vote Information**
```solidity
voteInfo[proposalId] = VoteInfo({
    direction: support,
    blockNumber: block.number,
    txHash: blockhash(block.number - 1),
    timestamp: block.timestamp,
    votingPower: votingPower,
    reason: reason
});
```

#### **Level 3: Historical Vote Archive**
```solidity
allVotes[voteCount] = newVote;  // Store in chronological order
voteCount++;  // Track total votes cast
```

### 2. **Vote Verification System**

The contract includes **robust vote verification**:

```solidity
function verifyVote(uint256 proposalId) internal view returns (bool) {
    VoteInfo memory info = voteInfo[proposalId];
    if (info.blockNumber == 0) return false;

    // Verify the vote was cast in a valid state
    IGovernor.ProposalState state = COMPOUND_GOVERNOR.state(proposalId);
    if (state != IGovernor.ProposalState.Active && 
        state != IGovernor.ProposalState.Pending) {
        return false;
    }

    // Verify the transaction hash matches
    if (info.txHash != blockhash(info.blockNumber - 1)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Verify the contract has voted
    if (!COMPOUND_GOVERNOR.hasVoted(proposalId, address(this))) {
        return false;
    }

    // Verify the vote direction matches
    if (info.direction != contractVoteDirection[proposalId]) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

## Performance Tracking and Accountability

### 1. **Delegate Performance Metrics**

The contract tracks **comprehensive performance data**:

```solidity
struct DelegateInfo {
    uint256 successfulVotes;      // Votes that aligned with winning outcome
    uint256 totalVotes;           // Total votes cast
    uint256 totalRewardsEarned;   // COMP earned from successful votes
    uint256 totalVotingPowerUsed; // Cumulative voting power across all votes
    uint256 averageVotingPowerPerVote; // Average voting power per vote
}

DelegateInfo public delegateInfo;
```

### 2. **Performance Updates**

Performance is updated **automatically** after each vote:

```solidity
// Update delegate performance metrics
delegateInfo.totalVotingPowerUsed += votingPower;
delegateInfo.averageVotingPowerPerVote = delegateInfo.totalVotingPowerUsed / voteCount;
```

And **after proposal resolution**:

```solidity
if (delegateVotedCorrectly) {
    delegateInfo.successfulVotes += 1;
    delegateInfo.totalRewardsEarned += winningStakes;
}
delegateInfo.totalVotes += 1;
```

## Staking and Incentive Alignment

### 1. **Proposal Staking System**

Delegators can **stake COMP on proposal outcomes** to incentivize correct voting:

```solidity
function stakeForProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, uint256 amount) external {
    // Stake COMP on For (1) or Against (0) outcome
    if (support == 1) {
        proposalStakes[proposalId][msg.sender].forStake += uint128(amount);
        totalStakesFor[proposalId] += amount;
    } else {
        proposalStakes[proposalId][msg.sender].againstStake += uint128(amount);
        totalStakesAgainst[proposalId] += amount;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Stake Distribution Based on Vote Accuracy**

The contract **distributes stakes based on vote accuracy**:

```solidity
if (delegateVotedCorrectly) {
    // Delegate gets 100% of winning stakes
    if (winningSupport == 1) {
        COMP_TOKEN.transfer(owner(), totalStakesFor[proposalId]);
    } else {
        COMP_TOKEN.transfer(owner(), totalStakesAgainst[proposalId]);
    }
} else {
    // All stakes returned to delegators
    // (handled in reclaimStake function)
}
```

## Security and Transparency Features

### 1. **Reentrancy Protection**

All critical functions use **ReentrancyGuard**:

```solidity
contract Compensator is ERC20, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    function castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, string memory reason) 
        external nonReentrant {
        _castVote(proposalId, support, reason);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**

The contract **strictly follows** the CEI pattern:

```solidity
function _castVote(...) internal {
    // CHECKS
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "Only owner can cast votes");
    require(support <= 1, "Invalid support value");
    
    // EFFECTS
    contractVoted[proposalId] = true;
    contractVoteDirection[proposalId] = support;
    voteInfo[proposalId] = newVote;
    
    // INTERACTIONS
    COMPOUND_GOVERNOR.castVote(proposalId, support);
}
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Event Emission**

The contract emits **detailed events** for transparency:

```solidity
event VoteCast(
    uint256 indexed proposalId,
    uint8 support,
    uint256 blockNumber,
    bytes32 txHash
);

event VoteCastWithReason(
    uint256 indexed proposalId,
    uint8 support,
    uint256 blockNumber,
    bytes32 txHash,
    uint256 votingPower,
    string reason
);
```
